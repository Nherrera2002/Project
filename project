========

In this case study, I will work as a junior data analyst for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer 
of health-focused products for women. The company aims to analyze smart device fitness data to unlock new growth opportunities. 
My task is to analyze smart device usage data and apply the insights to one of Bellabeat's products in order to guide the company's marketing strategy.

To accomplish this, I will go through the data analysis process, which includes asking the right questions, preparing and processing the data, analyzing it,
and finally sharing your findings and recommendations. The case study provides a roadmap with guiding questions and key tasks to help me stay on track.

The characters in the case study include Urška Sršen, the co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, Sando Mur, a mathematician and co-founder, and the 
Bellabeat marketing analytics team, of which you are a member.

The products I will be focusing on are the Bellabeat app, Leaf (a wellness tracker), Time (a wellness watch), Spring (a smart water bottle), and the 
Bellabeat membership program.

Key tasks
1. Identify the business task
2. Consider key stakeholders



During the data analysis process for the Bellabeat case study, it was identified that the provided data had errors and inconsistencies, making it 
unreliable to some extent. However, with data cleansing techniques, the issues were addressed to improve the data quality.

The data was obtained from various sources, including smart devices and user interactions with the Bellabeat app. Duplicate records were removed, 
missing values were handled through imputation techniques, and inconsistencies in data formatting were resolved.

Despite the data challenges, the analysis focused on identifying trends in smart device usage and understanding their relevance to Bellabeat customers. 
Statistical techniques, exploratory data analysis, and visualization tools were utilized to uncover key patterns and relationships within the data.

The analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, which informed high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing 
strategy. By aligning the company's offerings with the identified trends, Bellabeat can better cater to customer needs and enhance its market position.

In conclusion, the data quality issues were addressed through data cleansing, enabling meaningful insights and recommendations to be derived 
from the analysis.
